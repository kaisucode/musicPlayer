Tom Marvelo Riddle -> I am lord Voldemort -> Mr. Tom, A dildo lover



Regretting all the ships that never sailed. 

Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven. 

I am both amused and annoyed that you think I should be less stubborn than you are

I'm not gonna look back and regret the things I didn't do. 
I wanna look back and regret the things I did do.

The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me. Slightly

You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... Like you.

"Ah, but are we not, in some ways, all trapped in a labyrinth of our own making?" the Goblin King asked lightly. 

Changed. 
The man into a monster, 
the boy into a changeling, 
the composer to a madwoman. 
We are butterflies and the Underground is our chrysalis, 
a place of transformations and magic and miracles. 

"But you, mischling," Twig said softly. 
"You understand what it is to love the world entire. 
You have walked amongst mortals, you have lived amongst them. 
You have even loved them, in the only way we fey know how. 
Distantly. Dispassionately. But it does not mean it is any less deep. "

Once there was a little girl who played her music for a little boy in the wood. 
She was the genius, he was the interpreter, 
and they were the gardeners of the other's heart, taming, tilling, and tending the fertile soil of their souls
until they blossomed into a far-reaching forest that encompassed the world. 

For love is our only immortality, and when memory is faded and gone, it is our legacies that endure. 

------------------------------------------------------------
You spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you'll escape it one day, and how awesome it will be, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the present. 

It means 'that which the sea breaks against', and I love that. 

I may die young, but at least I'll die smart.

I just did some calculations and I've been able to determine that you're full of shit.

I was gawky and she was gorgeous and I was hopelessly boring and she was endlessly fascinating. So I walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk, thinking that if people were rain, I was drizzle and she was hurricane.

I wanted to be one of those people with streaks to maintain, who scorch the ground with their intensity. But for now, at least I knew such people, and they needed me, just like comets need tails.

When adults say, "Teenagers think they are invincible" with that sly, stupid smile on their faces, they don't know how right they are. We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken. We think that we are invincible because we are. We cannot be born, and we cannot die. Like all energy, we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations. They forget that when they get old. They get scared of losing and failing. But that part of us greater than the sum of our parts cannot begin and cannot end, and so it cannot fail.

People, I thought, wanted security. They couldn't bear the idea of death being a big black nothing, couldn't bear the thought of their loved ones not existing, and couldn't even imagine themselves not existing. I finally decided that people believed in an afterlife because they couldn't bear not to.

I fear oblivion. I fear it like the proverbial blind man who's afraid of the dark.

It does not taste like God Himself cooked heaven into a series of five dishes which were then served to you accompanied by several
luminous balls of fermented, bubbly plasma while actual and literal flower petals floated down all around your canal-side dinner table.

It’s just that most really good-looking people are stupid, so I exceed expectations.

You don’t get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.

------------------------------------------------------------
I hadn't realized I was a villain in your narrative

“I expected an answer more along the lines of, ‘Don’t ask stupid questions you already know the answer to,’ or my timeless favorite, ‘Go to hell.’ ”

Shadowhunters: looking better in black than the widows of our enemies since 1234.

I dont want to be a man. 
I want to be an angst-ridden teenager who can't confront his own inner demons 
and takes it out verbally on other people instead.

Break my heart. Break it in pieces. I give you permission.

They say time heal all wounds, but that presumes the source of the grief is finite

And there is a difference between having your heart break and having your soul shatter

I'm going to buy goldfish and feed them blood until they acquire a taste for human flesh

Behold, the field in which I grow my fucks. Lay thine eyes upon it and thou shall see that it is barren.

If I cannot move Heaven, I will raise hell

We are but dust and shadows
Pulvis Et Umbra Sumus

Lex malla, lex nulla

Ave atque vale

Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa

And I am a prince of Faerie, Son of the King, 
Prince of the Frost Court, Keeper of the Cold Way,
Wild Hunter, and Sword of the Host. Do not annoy me.

To love is to destroy, and to be loved is to be the one destroyed

I cannot hear my heart or what it says. I can only hear the wind.

I am cortana of the same steel and temper as joyeuse and durendal

"Hey, um, I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for a friend of mine", he says. 
"Have you seen her? She's a tiny little thing, cries a lot, spends too much time with her feelings-"
"Shut up, Kenji. "

"Damn," Kenji says after a moment. "Damn damn damn. This shit is bananas."

"These two definitely don't require an introduction, but, as you can see, ", he says, "they look a little different now.
Behold, the transformative powers of being held hostage by a bunch of sadistic bastards!" 
He flourishes a hand in their direction, his sarcasm accompanied by a brittle smile. 
"Now they look like a pair of wildebeests. But, you know, by comparison, I look like a damn king. 
So it's good news all around."

I'm so scared that if I move even an inch, my body will snap in half and everyone will see that my insides are made up of nothing but all the tears I'm swallowing back right now. 

If you hide your heart, he will never be able to take it from you
